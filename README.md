# Supply-Chain-Shipment-price-prediction
This is my internship project, In this I took a dataset which contained information regarding supply chain of various pharma companies and then I processed that data set applied various machine learning models to predict the right price for any shipment

The Dataset had intially 33 columns, however after cleaning, processing, feature selection and engineering I concluded that the following 5 features contribute most to the Shipment price determinations :

1. Line Item Quantity
2. Freight Cost (USD)
3. Weight (Kilograms)
4. Pack Price
5. Unit Price

Then I created a model using the following features to predict the shipment prices.

I have deployed the model using a streamlit webapp, 

[The Link for the webapp is available here](https://tanmaysk001-supply-chain-shipment-price-pr-prices-webapp-e8eji9.streamlit.app/)

I have also created a Tableau notebook to share my analysis and insights from the data. You can find the Tableau file **'Book1.twb'** in the repository
